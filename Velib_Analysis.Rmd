## 1. Presentation of the Project Notebook

### 1.1 Dataset Description

Public transportation have made a huge progress these last years
especially when it comes to green mobility.Indeed, public city bikes are
flourishing in urban areas for offering a fast and environmental
friendly way to travel for people. As the demand increases while public
powers are putting efforts in developing bike lanes instead of roads.
However if it is growing too fast , city centers could face local
shortages if every city area is not well equipped with enough city
bikes.

This data analysis project is conducted over an hourly updated dataset
of Paris citybikes called Velib. That is why in this exploratory
analysis shortages per areas (18 totally in Paris) will be showcased for
drawing some recommendations on further locations to build.

Paris has more than 1400 stations and more than 400km2 covered with
mechanical and ebikes. Data is updated in real time what allows to see
the evolution of service in terms of available bikes for each station.

Here are listed below the variables of this dataset :

1.  **stationCode : chr**

2.  **station_id : num**

3.  **num_bikes_available: int (Number of bikes available)**

4.  **mechanical : int (Number of mechanicald Bikes available)**

5.  **ebike : int (Number of Ebikes available)**

6.  **numBikesAvailable : int (Total Number of bikes available)**

7.  **num_docks_available: int (Number of docks available)**

8.  **numDocksAvailable : int**

9.  **is_installed : int (Wether if the station is installed or not
    1-yes 0-no)**

10. **is_returning : int (1- bike is returned 0-bike is not)**

11. **is_renting : int (1-bike is rented 0-bike is not)**

12. **last_reported : int (timestamp when the situation was reported)**

13. **name : chr (name of the station)**

14. **lat : num (latitude of the station)**

15. **lon : num (longitude of the station)**

16. **capacity : num (total capacity of the station)**

17. **rental_methods : (NA refers to subscription CREDIT CARD to one
    time payment)**

Quick explanation of the dataset : the above aggregated data is directly
obtained by GET request from public APIs.Each time the API is called the
sent response is capturing the situation of bike trafic in Paris. As
bike come and go the number of bikes available and dock available varies
depending on the number of bikes actually rented during two time
periods. One line equals to one transaction when each time a bike is
rented.

For this analysis we will only take in account the transactions made in
year 2022.

### 1.2 Dataset settings adjustments

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# read from local csv 
velib <- read.csv(file = "/Users/guilhemjolly/velib.csv")

#as station id and station code are numerics let's convert it in strings
velib$station_id  <- as.character(velib$station_id)
velib$stationCode <- as.character(velib$station_id)

#as the same date has to be converted from an int to a date format
velib$last_reported <- as.POSIXct(velib$last_reported, origin="1970-01-01")
```

## 2. Descriptive Analysis

### 2.1 Overview

A good analysis starts with removing outliers. As a matter of fact do
you have noticed that some the old transactions were reported in 2018 ?
Obviously we can formulate some hypothesis about this. Every user is not
peculiar when it comes to ride or park a bike. And some have seen their
beloved ones ending in the waters of the Seine or broken by accident. ðŸ˜¢

Life is though for citybikes, but numerous ones are still remaining and
are used everyday without being seriously damaged. That is why remaining
operational bikes will only be taken in account in this study.

However feel free to play with the transactions that were reported
before this year !

```{r, echo = FALSE}
#filter by year 2022
velib <- velib %>%
  filter(as.Date(velib$last_reported) >= "2022-01-01")

head(velib,5)
```

There is no precise variable to estimate the number of bikes like a
unique id for each bike actually in function.Nevertheless, the total
number of bikes can be estimated by the number of docks assuming that
there are as many docks as bikes available and this number of docks
remains stable over time.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
station <- dbGetQuery(conn, 'SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT station_id) as count_station
                               FROM Velib_Data')

docks <- velib %>%
  distinct(station_id, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%
  summarise(total_count = sum(num_docks_available))

total_bikes_available <- velib %>%
  group_by(export_date) %>%
  distinct(station_id, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%
  summarise(total_mechanical = sum(mechanical),
            total_ebike = sum(ebike))

#count the number of distinct stations in each date grouping
nb_stations <- velib %>% 
  select(station_id, export_date) %>% 
  group_by(station_id, export_date) %>%
  summarise(total = n(),
            .groups = 'drop')

docks
total_bikes_available

```

After filtering by date the count for each day analysed the count of
stations is successively 1444,1452 and 1452. However this might be to a
lack of data sent for one station. Let's assume that the number of
stations count is stable.

The 1452 stations are counting bikes with mechanical and e bikes over
the fleet. **Mechanical bikes are representing more than 2/3 of the
bikes population in Paris !**

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# install customization libraries
library(viridis)
library(hrbrthemes)

#proportion of mechnanical and ebikes over the fleet
biketype_plot2 <- ggplot(total_bikes_available, aes(x = export_date, y = total_mechanical)) +
geom_col()

biketype_plot3 <- ggplot(total_bikes_available, aes(x = export_date, y = total_ebike)) +
geom_col()

biketype_plot2

biketype_plot3
```

As we can see there the number of bikes available remains stable from
day to day.

However, as you might have noticed the number of bikes available equals
the number of mechanical and e bikes lastly reported in the station. But
it does not mean that every bike is fully operational. One way to
challenge this KPI is to compare for every bike station how many bikes
are rented for one day (ie counting the number of transaction lines) and
the number of bikes available.

### How many bikes are rented on a daily basis ?

```{r}
#create a new column for grouping the dates per hour and analyse the number of bikes rented during the day 8th December.
rented <- velib %>%
  filter(last_reported > as.POSIXct('2022-12-08 00:00:00')) %>%
  group_by(Hour = floor_date(last_reported,"1 hour")) %>% 
  mutate(rented_count = sum(is_renting))

rented_plot <- ggplot(rented,aes(x = Hour, y = rented_count)) + 
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Count of rented bikes over time",
       x = 'Date',
       y  = 'Count of Rented bikes')

rented_plot
```

### What is the most common rental method ?

City bikes can be easily used with city transportation card with a
significant discount on all subscription. So we might think that bikes
are more rented by subscription rather than with Credit Card which means
that the user is unlocking the bike for a single ride.

```{r}

payment <- dbGetQuery(conn, 'SELECT rental_methods, count(*) as subscription
                             FROM Velib_Data
                             WHERE rental_methods IS NULL
                             UNION
                             SELECT rental_methods, count(*) as subscription
                             FROM Velib_Data
                             WHERE rental_methods == "CREDITCARD"')
  
payment
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
payment_plot <- ggplot(payment, aes(fill = rental_methods,x = rental_methods, y = subscription)) + 
geom_col(position="stack", stat="identity") + 
labs(title = "Payment method",
     x = "Rental Method",
     y = "Number of rentals") +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Spectral") + 
   theme_minimal()

payment_plot

```

Unlike what could be assumed the single ride payment is the most used
rental method. In proportion it is more than **88% !** Numerous reasons
can be given for explaining such gap but maybe locals are not using as
many as citybikes as tourists, or they are not aware that a monthly
subscription will cost as much as the same as a single ride.

## Local Analysis

### What is the variation of bikes available within a day ?

In order to analyse which stations are lacking city bikes, first step
consists in seeing how many bikes are available within a day to analyse
peak hours. As each line refers to one transaction let's create a table
with all the transaction done within one day.

```{r}
trafic <-  velib %>%
  group_by(hour = format(
    as.POSIXct(
    floor_date(last_reported,"1 hour")),
    format = '%H')) %>% 
#for one station it could have several transactions per hour 
    distinct(hour,station_id, .keep_all = T) %>% 
  summarize(total_availability = sum(num_bikes_available)) %>%
#removing the outliers from the hours not recorded during the night 
  filter(hour > '09')

trafic


trafic_plot <- ggplot(trafic, aes(x = hour, y = total_availability)) +
  geom_col()+
  labs(title = 'Number of bikes available over time',
       x = 'hour',
       y = 'number of bikes') 

trafic_plot
```

### Number of transactions within a day

As the data frame append lines when a new transaction is reported, we
would want to monitor the available number of bikes from one station to
another but limit the number of points entered. For doing this, one way
is to rank all stations per number of transactions and show this KPI.

```{r}
# counting the number of transactions per citybike stations  
#as the calls were not made hour per hour regularly on one day get rid of the date to only have the hour. We assume here that the trafic does not vary from one day to another excepting week-ends. 

transaction_count <- velib %>%
  group_by(hour = format(
    as.POSIXct(
    floor_date(last_reported,"1 hour")),
    format = '%H')) %>% 
  filter(is_renting == 1) %>% 
  count(station_id, wt = is_renting) %>%
  summarise(total_transactions = sum(n))

transaction_count

transaction_count_plot <- ggplot(transaction_count, aes(x = hour, y = total_transactions)) +
geom_col() + 
labs (title = "Total transactions per hour",
      x = "hour",
      y = "count")

transaction_count_plot
```

According the graph the number of transactions is peaking between 19:00
and 20:00 at 12606. Considering the total amount of bikes available in
the city that is to say the number of docks equals the number of bikes
in available on station plus those rented is 29755, **more than 42% of
bikes in the city are rented in this time frame !**

### How much sales regarding these transactions ?

Assuming this data, it could be great to see how much turnover is doing
Velib' on single ride rentals. Nevertheless, it is not possible to
correctly know how much it is for subscriptions as different
subscription methods are existing at different fees.

In the following part of the study we will assume that payment with
credit card will only be one time payment that don't exceed 45 min (time
when you get charged extra fee). For the need of the study we will
timeframe the day in 3 parts : morning (from 00:00 AM to 12:00AM),
afternoon (from 12:01 AM to 6:00PM) and evening (from 6:01 PM to 00:00
AM).

A single ride is costing 3â‚¬ for a mechanical or an ebike.

```{r}
#take the transaction count and filtering by rental_methods
turnover_over_date <-  velib %>%
  group_by(hour = format(
    as.POSIXct(
    floor_date(last_reported,"1 hour")),
    format = '%H')) %>% 
  
 #filterig by is_renting otherwise the user is not debited of his ride 
  filter(is_renting == 1,
         rental_methods == "CREDITCARD") %>% 
  count(station_id, wt = is_renting) %>%
  summarise(turnover = sum(n)*3)


turnover_morning <- turnover_over_date %>%
  filter(hour < '12' & hour > '00') %>%
  summarise(total = sum(turnover))

turnover_after_noon <- turnover_over_date %>%
  filter(hour < '18' & hour > '12') %>%
  summarise(total = sum(turnover))

turnover_evening <- turnover_over_date %>%
  filter(hour < '24' & hour > '18') %>%
  summarise(total = sum(turnover))

turnover_morning
turnover_after_noon
turnover_evening

#display the turnover for one day
turnover_plot <- ggplot(turnover_over_date, aes(x = hour, y = turnover)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = function(x) format(x, scientific = FALSE)) +
  labs(title = 'turnover over time by creditcard payment segment',
       x = 'Date',
       y = 'turnover')

turnover_plot

```

Interesting ! The turnover made between 20:00 and 21:00 is twice as much
as the turnover made between 22:00 and 23:00 and peaks at **15000 â‚¬**.
In the evening the computed turnover made in the evening is **102534 â‚¬**
! Comparing to the afternoon it is 3 times bigger !

# Conclusion

This exploratory data analysis has led us to understand more indepth
which are the rental trends in terms of trafic over the day, prefered
rental methods by users and how bike availability can be impacted.
Obviously all the variables did not have all been used. Here are some
additional ideas for some exploratory analysis about citybikes.

-   Seizing the number of stations in each Parisian disctrict and
    computing the number of bikes in order to see which district is in
    tension compared to the others

-   Extend this analysis to scooters

-   Predict the most recurring pathways traveled by users between bike
    stations. This analysis will imply tracking bikes id with other
    tools like instant tracking of scooters for example.
